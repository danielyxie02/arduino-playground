This is an attempted recreation of ACNH's island tune editor. Each of the 16 buttons maps to a note; pressing it increments the note by half a step. 

The range of the notes is [C4, B5], and long notes and rests are allowed. The play button is used to request to play the song and also to scroll through "Isabelle"'s dialogue.

Music is played with a stepper motor.
